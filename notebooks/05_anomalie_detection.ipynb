    "# What is Time Series Anomaly?\n",
    "In time series data, an anomaly or outlier can be termed as a data point which is not following the common collective trend or seasonal or cyclic pattern of the entire data and is significantly distinct from rest of the data. By significant, most data scientists mean statistical significance, which in order words, signify that the statistical properties of the data point is not in alignment with the rest of the series.\n",
